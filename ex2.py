"""
Write a function EvenOdd that takes a list of numbers and analyzes them. If the current number is even, then it will be copied at the beginning
of the list containing the result. If odd, instead, the number will be copied at the end of the resulting list.

Example:

Input: [1,1,2,1]
Output: [2,1,1,1]

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4,2,1,3]

    return result
